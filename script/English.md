So suddenly, you open your eyes. You feel a burning in your head, and the world, is spinning.  You try, try to remember what was happening to you, but as you try, a deeper  dizzy feeling occurs to you. The disorderly figures, a revolving world......"

“What...what is this place?”

“What happening......Why, why I am here?”

Far away, a figure shows...

----

Memory_1   

Your memory starts here. Off-white sheets, large courtyard covered with withered leaves. This is an orphanage. The yard is always stale, gray, and deadly silent. The only hope in this memory is an accompanying figure. He is the only one who shines happiness to your pale life whenever you feel lost. Though you cannot remember his appearance, you find him familiar.

 

Memory_2    

The cake for Sunday had been robbed by elder children again. Do not forget to avoid everyone next time.

Today he took the little wood carving back for you when some other child robbed that. You remember the warmth and sense of stability when he fondled your head. “Mom and dad will bless you in heaven,” he always said. But in the orphanage, boys who bullied you said you are just a homeless child with no father and mother…

 

Blood fingerprints   

Blood fingerprints, blood fingerprints, and blood fingerprints appeared again and again. What are they? It reminds you of the endless nightmare that always wakes you up at night. Why do these blood handprints appear in your dreams with sharp cries from numerous people? Where do they come from?

 

Diary_1

Mom and dad have passed away for four years. I miss them. I was awakened by the nightmare again… However, Xiaoxiao found brother’s secret. He looks like a reliable brother in front of me, but during the night he cries quietly in his bed…

Xiaoxiao 

 

Memory_3   

Adults said you must go to school, but you do not like the school. The boy sitting in the front row called you “bastard” in front of everyone. Your deskmate sat far away from you as if you were smelly. Teachers seem to dislike you as well, because you were not smart. In PE class, no team wanted you because you were thin and ran slowly.

 

Diary_2 

2002.10.23   

Why don’t I have parents? Why do all my classmates know I am an orphan? How do I face their eyes? I never have the chance to get snacks after school brought by my parents, nor do I have change to by a new stationary. Stay alone in the corner under the shadow, so that no one will see me.

Xiaoxiao

 

Amputated limb    

Bodies and amputated limbs all over the ground. On the wrist of a broken arm wearing fragmentized black suit wears a silver watch. With all blood cleaned, the watch shows a time of 2:28 and a word “Lin XX” engraved on its back.

Memory_4

 有天晚上，哥哥坐在床头，和你一起回忆爸爸妈妈。他说，妈妈是四十多岁才生下你们，小时候，妈妈常常被人认成你们的奶奶，哥哥总会偷偷难过。于是妈妈每隔一段时间就会染一次头发。爸爸年纪很大了，但那双苍老的手，依然能扛起很重的大米，走很远的山路。

 

Memory_5

He taught you math tonight. When he asked if you still had nightmares at night, you lied. He promised you that he would tell you the reason for those strange dreams some day, but you had no courage to tell him the truth, that those dreams appeared more and more often. Memories, some fuzzy and some clear, were all  into a black net that held you inside. It seems that you can never get rid of the nightmare…

 

Memory_6

You lied in orphanage and told your brother in sobs that you missed mom and dad and you wanted to go home. He was stunned for a moment, and then quickly choked his tears that almost came out. Sitting by you tenderly and carefully organizing the words, for the first time he told you about the mudslide that destroyed your home. At the time, houses in the village were submerged, and you were trapped in the factory seeing distant torrents coming. Many villagers gave up and stood by windows desperately. The windows were covered with their mud handprints. However, it was mom and dad who did not gave up the last hope and saved you and brother. Dad leaned over and let mom sit on his shoulders. Holding brother and you in her arms, mom lifted you up with all her strength. When the mudslide poured into the factory and gradually engulfed familiar faces, dad stood as high as he could, and mom tried her best to stretch her arms higher. They tried their best to position brother and you safely…

Brother said, “You may not remember in fever at that time… When the mudslide submerge dad’s shoulder and mom’s knees, they looked up, gazed at you in tears, and said softly, ‘Don’t be afraid. Dad loves you, mom loves you…’”

 

Memory_7

2006.04.08 

Ms.Lin adopted brother and me. Finally we could leave the orphanage. It is said that Ms.Lin is a teacher in brother’s dream high school. Ms.Lin is really a good person. She is the best one to Xiaoxiao other than brother. Thanks to Ms.Lin, brother did not have to be distracted by teaching me when he prepared for high school. I am going to that high school! Together with brother and Ms.Lin!

Xiaoxiao

 

Note

You found a note that seemed to be torn off by some one. It read, “Who can I write blessings to…”It s eems to be your handwriting. You recalled that yesterday was Mother’s Day, and a teacher asked you to write a holiday card to your mothers. This reminded you of your parents’ death. You wrote the words down on your scratch book in sorrow, and quickly tore the note off so that others would not see it…

 

Dead soul

“Why, why monsters at night seem familiar?

They seem like… some schoolmates?!

Is it an illusion… or?”

 

Memory_8

You were admitted. Classmates in high school were friendly, and you have made some good friends. Brother, Ms.Lin, and friends made up all of your life. Staying at either home or school everyday, a simple and peaceful life makes you extremely happy. You were finally living a normal life…

 

Memory_9

In addition to staying with friends and brother, you still don’t like to go to or talk in crowded places. Brother was popular in school, as expected, but he still thought of you. He always went to your classroom to see if you have had classes well and prepared to protect you if anyone bullied you; when he bought drinks, he never forgot to bring you one; when you went to canteen with him, he always let you sit at the table and bought lunch for you.

 

Birthday card

You prepared a birthday card for brother and bought him a new schoolbag with your pocket money. On the card, you wrote welcome to adulthood and thanked him for taking care of you for the last thirteen years. Why, you recalled that brother is going to college soon, which means you will be separated from him, separated for the first time since birth.

 

Phantom

You saw the hell. The whole world turned upside down. The familiar faces were covered with strange and ferocious expressions: fear and panic. They opened their mouth and cried, while you could hear nothing but huge roars. Somehow you could not think.

Someone shouted “Xiaoxiao” by your ear.

What happened? Is it your illusion? Why your heart is flooded with sorrow? Or, is it the possibility that you do not even dare to think about…

---

Looking at the familiar but strange figure in front of you, you are filled with panic.

“Why, brother, why am I here?”

“Haven’t you already seen the truth? From now on, I cannot accompany you any longer.”

“Why not? Is it because you are going to college?”

“Xiaoxiao, I hope so, too. However, this is death, not parting…”

 

Enter the real time:

---

You seem to know everything. Yes, the time now is 2:28pm, May 12 2008.

This place is the dream world your brother created for you when he was dying. You have become timid and introverted since your parents’ death and depended on him very much. How could someone who is so afraid of departing like you accept his death? Therefore, he hoped you could get rid of the childhood nightmare and gain a firm belief in living from the experience in the dream world…

But now, what is your choice?

Thousands of days and nights passed, while the real world just went by a moment.

If you stay, you can live with your brother forever; if you leave, the dream will collapse, but you will get a lifelong strong belief. You will not be bothered by the childhood nightmare any more. You will never be stunned by the future.

However, in order to save you, your brother did not stop digging a gap for you even if he was pierced by a steel bar and his hands became bloody… Once you leaved the dream, time in the real world would continue, and he would die soon.

---

“I do not want to leave brother alone. I want to stay with him…”

Brother looked conflicted, but smiled at last.

“Well, are you still not grown up? Alright… Let us stay here. Let me be with you forever.”

-----

Leave:

You cannot stop crying, but your eyes grow firm. “I see, brother. I… I will go on.” Brother smiled with relief. His figure turns into light spots all over the sky, and converges into a letter in your hands.



Sister:

I only have these limited years to stay with you. I often ask myself if I am responsible enough…

What I am most afraid of is that I have to be separated from you some day. The second, is that it is too late to say goodbye to you when the time comes. Sadly, it is finally the time…

I was once confused. We lived at the price of our parents’ death. I do not know what kind of person we become would be worth their effort.

One day I came through. I found that the biggest hope from our family is safety and happiness.

Like mom and dad, they smiled at us even in the last moment of their life, even they were old, even they were suffering… They hoped the last figure in our mind is them smiling.

It is their smile that supports me till now.

I am the same to you.

I love you deeply.

No matter where I am.

 May you be tenacious of the nightmare. May you be strong and be free of past memories in your bright future.

Nightmares will not last forever, but life never stops moving on.

----

Stay: 

You: I...I don't want you to be here alone, brother...

Brother looks at you with a slight complexity. And finally it turns into a helpless smile, "You, sigh. Still don't grow up? All right...Then stay here and let your brother continue to accompany you, forever."
